  <h2>Bass Lemon</h2>
  <h3>2014-2020</h3>
  <p>
    Bass Lemon was a funk-rock band.
    I started Bass Lemon with my friends when I was a teenager.
    During the time we were active we played at venues in and around Fremantle and Perth.
    We also played at Nannup and Fairbridge music festivals.

    <li>Give Me a Slice</li>
    <li>The Christmas Tree Song</li>
    <li>Jimi Hendrix</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cerauno</h2>
  <h3>2021-Present</h3>
  <p>
    My bass playing friend, Fred, got me involved in Cerauno after the previous
    keyboard player left. Cerauno is more of a soul/R&B/funk kind of deal.
    We haven't record much yet but I'm hoping to change that soon.
